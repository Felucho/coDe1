Code in DroidScript

// from forum DS, group from google


You can have a look at my code collection where I show some of my projects to show what is possible with DroidScript (and a few of other people)
You can run the spk or apk if it exists and try to reprogram it.
I would start with simple in- and output programs or somes who supports you to code or manageing your apps - file picker for example.

later you can continue with graphics and first little games (if you want to work in that direction (like me for instance ;)

the link to my dropbox collection is

For questions ask in this forum or me directly if you want to ask smth about my collected samples

Hope I could help you a bit
